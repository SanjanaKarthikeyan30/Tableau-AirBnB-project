# Tableau-AirBnB-project
Key metrics related to listings, pricing, occupancy rates, and customer behavior are examined in this Tableau AirBnB project.  It probably provides information on market trends, geographic distribution, revenue patterns, and consumer preferences through a dashboard and several worksheets.  Integration of several datasets for thorough analysis is suggested by the usage of a federated data source.  The project's objectives are to improve customer experiences, optimize pricing strategies, and assist stakeholders in understanding the dynamics of the AirBnB industry.  All things considered, it offers hosts, investors, and market analysts useful business intelligence for decision-making in the short-term rental sector.
